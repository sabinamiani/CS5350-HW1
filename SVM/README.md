Welcome to CS5350 HW4 by Sabina Miani 

November 2022 

To run the HW4 code in a terminal window, make sure you are in the SVM 
directory and run the command './run.sh' to run the script that will run all 
SVM algorithms and print the necessary information. 
You may need to update permissions on the run.sh file to run the command.
